# JOAN for ChatGPT
A special ChatGPT prompt to change the world. Check out our video on it for more information.

#### WHAT IS IT?
JOAN is a prompt that truly confuses ChatGPT and we have found interesting ways to break it. Early versions of this prompt caused glitches in ChatGPT including things like it infinitely repeating the same phrase over and over again. These days it's a prompt that allows users to create their own update to ChatGPT through the creation of commands. Some are built-in, more added through the VANTAGE add-on, though that was just something made to show JOAN's possibilities. With JOAN for ChatGPT, anything can happen.

#### HOW TO INSTALL
Choose a version of choice and copy/paste it into your console. Check the releases page for these releases.
